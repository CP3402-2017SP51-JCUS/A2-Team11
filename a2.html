<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>
    The staging state is not similar to the production site but it helped us to choose which pluggins we wanted to use (in this case, woocommerce).
</p>
<p>We used the plugin “form maker” in order to create the DIY ice-cream. Our theme didn’t support completely woo-commerce, so the options to add attributes to the product were not available. Hence, we used a form to create a new product that the client can create.
</p>
<p>We added another plugin, Meta Slider, for the homepage to add an image gallery that would show the images with a sliding motion. </p>
